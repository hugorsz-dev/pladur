Pladur: IA querys for text games, with tesseract

Pytesseract is the program that converts on-screen text into a readable format: that is, from image to text.
To do this, you need to have the program installed in a known location, which should be listed in the config.json file.
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

And within that folder, in "tessdata" should be the "spa.traineddata" file (or the language of your preference), downloadable at:
